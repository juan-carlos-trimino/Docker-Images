# Before the docker CLI sends the context to the docker daemon, it looks for a file named '.dockerignore' in the root directory
# of the context. If this file exists, the CLI modifies the context to exclude files and directories that match patterns in it.
# This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them
# to images using ADD or COPY.
# Ignore everything
**

# Include this directory...
!Message-CS/
# ... but ignore these subdirectories...
Message-CS/.vs
Message-CS/obj
Message-CS/bin
# ... and this file...
**/.gitignore

# Include this directory...
!Subscriber-CS/
# ... but ignore these subdirectories...
Subscriber-CS/.vs
Subscriber-CS/obj
Subscriber-CS/bin
# ... and this file...
**/.gitignore
